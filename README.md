# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to review the code created for Steve and **refactor** it to loop through all the data in the workbook at one time. The goal was code optimization, and I believe we've achieved that. By reviewing how we coded the 'green_stocks' workbook we were able to re-use some code and improve some code, thus improving overall functionality.
## Results
The phrase, "past performance is not an indicator of future returns" is a foundational idea when analyzing stocks, but with a little bit of Visual Basic for Applications coding the information Steve sought for his parent's investments became easier to visualize. Even though this was a project for a fellow financial analyst, I had user experience in mind when preparing the final product for Steve.
### Drab to Almost Fab
What began as a relatively ordinary MS Excel workbook that contained a not small amount of stock performance information became a macro-enabled, easy-to-use interface that does a bit more than simply output some stock information for a given year. <insert DQ Analysis Screen Shot and VBA Challenge Screenshot> The image on the left depicts the basic output of the original analysis for Steve with one stock. The image on the right depicts the final product (VBA Challenge) output that displays all green stocks. Note the more visually stimulating VBA Challenge output that allows the user to easily determine loss or gain with color coding. 
### What Happened in 20xx?!
When viewed side-by-side, stock performance in 2017 vastly outpaced that of 2018, with the only two solid performers being *ENPH* and *RUN*


## Summary
In a summary statement, address the following questions.
        What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
        How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
